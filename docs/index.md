## Schema

### Optional

- `disable_local_key_service` (Boolean) Disable the local key service. Can also be set using a non-empty `SOPS_DISABLE_LOCAL_KEY_SERVICE` environment variable. If set, you must provide `key_service_uris` to make the key discovery work.
- `key_service_uris` (Set of String) The URIs of the key service. Can also be set using the comma-separated `SOPS_KEY_SERVICE_URIS` environment variable. You can start the server-side key service by running `sops keyserver` to enable remote key discovery. Examples: `tcp://myserver.com:5000`, `unix:///var/run/sops.sock`.
